//Write the following functions:
//
//Function called "sum", that takes two integer arguments and returns a sum of them
//Function called "diff", that takes two integer arguments and returns difference between first and second argument
//Function called "multiply", that takes two integer arguments and returns multiplication of them
//Function called "pow", that takes two integer arguments and returns the exponentiation result of first argument in power of second argument
//Function called "is_odd", that takes one integer argument and returns true if the number is odd and false otherwise
//Function called "max", that takes two integer arguments and returns the bigger of them
//Function called "min", that takes two integer arguments and returns the smaller of them
//Function called "abs", that takes one integer arguments and returns it's absolute value
//
//Yor repository should contain a folder "math", where "math.cpp" and "math.h" are present.
//"math/math.h" and "math/math.cpp" will be evaluated, so make sure everything needed contained there.
//also make sure to include "iostream" library in your header file, it is needed for evaluation.
